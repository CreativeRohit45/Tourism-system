			<h1>Machnur Fort, Solapur</h1>
			<p>This fort which was built in 1615 AD had stationed a huge battalion of the Mughal force. Aurangzeb had hosted his court matters in this very fort.There is a local tale linked to the naming of this fort. After capturing the village and nearby areas, Aurangzeb ordered his men to destroy the Shiv Linga but none of them succeeded due to a heavy attack of bees. Furious Aurangzeb later sent beef covered in a cloth as an offering to the Shiv linga as a measure of insult and disrespect. When the cloth was removed the beef turned into white flowers. Thatâ€™s why it became Maas-Noor and later Machnur. Deeply ashamed by this act Aurangzeb started annually two donations of Rs.400 and Rs.6. Even today the Government of Maharashtra gives an annual donation of Rs.480 to the temple.</p>
