			<h1>Akkalkot Swami Samarth</h1>
			<p>The Akkalkot Swami Samarth Maharaj Temple is one of the main attractions in the city of Solapur. It is dedicated to Swami Samarth Maharaj, a 19th century saint, who is believed to be an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. The temple sees thousands of devotees every year. The temple complex, also known as the Vatavruksh Mandir, houses an ancient Banyan tree. This is where the saint would preach to his followers. The tree is the main attraction in the temple today. There are a total of five temples which form the entire complex. The saintâ€™s belongings have been preserved here and are displayed for the benefit of his devotees. The temple is a peaceful pilgrimage center and a must-visit if one is in Solapur.</p>
