			<h1>Dhotri Fort, Solapur</h1>
			<p> The wall towards the right has an eastwards facing entrance to the citadel. Moving ahead from this doorway one comes across a dried up step well to the right. There are four bastions to the fort and the bastion to the south has a spiral stairway leading to the top which gives a complete view of the fort and its structure. After descending the bastion one comes across a room built in the fortified wall with a semi circle shaped roof. Moving ahead parallel to the fort wall one can see the remnants of the structure on the way to the West bastion. Here there is a small doorway covered in bushes which takes us to the rectangular open ground with fort wall on all sides and two bastions on its two corners. There is a dried up well to the right.</p>
