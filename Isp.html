			<h1>Iskcon Temple</h1>
			<p>This iskcon temple commemorates Lord Chaitanya's actual recorded visit to pandharpur in search of his brother. It reminds one of the reach of Krishna bhakti across India. The temple environment is serene and blissful with many trees around, beautifully decorated deities of lord Krishna and Radha devi ,there is a gaushala where we can touch and feeds cows and calf, at the extreme end we have bathing ghats to dip in to the chandrabhaga river where crowds are less compared to the other side of the river. 2 minutes away is another ashram dedicated to a local religious leader built in the traditional style with stones rather than a concrete building which is quite rare nowadays.</p>
