			<h1>Mangalwedha Fort, Solapur</h1>
			<p>The current structure of the fort is a small miniature fort type with four bastions and houses the office of Divisional Magistrate. The trench of the fort is now devastated. At the corner we can find some sculptures and idols of Gods and Goddesses. The present ruined state of the fort hints that the fort must have been huge in the earlier times. At the back of the fort there a temple of Lord Kashivishweshwar and a beautiful well. The scripture in the temple premises mentions that the temple was built in 1572 A.D. After descending a few steps in the well we come across an idol of Lord Bramha and also a secret chamber in the midst which opens out to the village. Near the college in the town we can see Veerghals and a beautiful carved pillar of the ancient temple.</p>
