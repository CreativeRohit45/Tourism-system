			<h1>Kaikadi Maharaj Mutt</h1>
			<p>This is a unique place in Solapur town, where almost all important Hindu scriptures and tales therefrom are depicted in the form of scale models, some looking even real size or even bigger. The idea was translated into reality due to the tireless efforts of Sri Kaikadi Maharaj â€“ a reputed Saint of the region. The display was arranged in such a way that one who joins the queue would have no option to go back but move only forward till he completes the whole show, winding through narrow corridors or tunnels or passages. At the end of it all there lies the Swamiji resting on a small make-to-do bed, in his hermitage. It can easily take about three hours before one gets the hang of the place.</p>
