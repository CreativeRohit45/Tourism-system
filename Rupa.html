			<h1>Rupabhavani Temple, Solapur</h1>
			<p>The temple was built by Bandoba Pawar, a great devotee of Rupa Bhavani who was blessed by the Goddess while ploughing a field. The idol of the Goddess is said to have emerged from the field when his plough got stuck at the very spot the temple has been built. Tuesdays and Fridays are the days of the week when a Mahapuja is performed for the Goddess. The Temple features ancient architecture with engravings depicting stories from Puranas.The best time to visit the Rupabhavani temple is during the Navratris when the weather is pleasant and travel friendly. The festival goes on for 9 days ending on the 10th day with a Palkhi procession in honour of the Goddess. The place is not crowded except on Tuesdays and Fridays and during the Navaratri Festival.</p>
